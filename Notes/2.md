# Cargo!

- Rust's build system and package manager.
  - From my first-ever time using it, it feels *so* much better than fucking CMake.
- It's job is to:
    1. Build code.
    2. Download libraries.
    3. Building those libraries/dependencies.

## Creating a Project via Cargo

- When creating a project with cargo, a folder is created.
- Within the folder, there's a `src` that contains the `.rs` file, and a `Cargo.toml` file.
- The project will also initializze a new Git repository.
  - Repositories won't be generated if `cargo new` is run within an existing repo. [I have a repo here, so it won't be initializing new ones under it!]

### TOML

- `Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language` is Cargo's configuration format.
- The first line is a that starts with `[package]` is called a **section heading**.
  - Section headings indicate that any following statements are configuring a package.
  - As a project grows, sections will be added.
  - The other lines are information that cargo needs in order to compile a program.
- `[dependencies]` is a way for me to list my project's dependencies.
  - These dependencies that come in packages of code are called `Crates`.
- Cargo expects `src` to have all the source files in the project.
- The top-level of the project is reserved for README files, license stuff, and configs.
- Cargo brings organization to projects (and appears far friendlier than CMake; that shit's painful).
- Converting a project that didn't primariily use Cargo is easy, just place the code into a `src` directory and create a `Cargo.toml` file.

## Building and Running a Cargo Project

- To build a Cargo project, use `cargo build` (That easy?).
  - This creates an executable in `target/debug/project_name.exe`.
  - The default build is a debug build.
  - Cargo puts the binary in a directory called `debug` that lives in the `target` directory apparently.
