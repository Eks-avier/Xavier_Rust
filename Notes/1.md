# What's in a basic Rust Program?

- `.rs` files are Rust files.
- Just like in C++, the `main` function is special!
- It appears to function in the exact same way too, as it is first to run in an executable program.
- It's convetional for the function body's curly braces not to wrap, apparently.
- *Spaces* are conventional, *not tabs*. Fascinating.
- `println!` is called a **Rust macro**.
  - If it were the function, it wouldn't have the `!`.
  - Using `!` means, I am calling a macro.
  - Macros **don't** always align with functions in terms of how they function.
  - Statements are ended with a semi-colon.

## Compiling and Debugging

- `.pdb` contains the debugging information.
- Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language.
